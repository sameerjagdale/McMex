McMex
The McMex project adds the Mex functionality to  McVM, a matlab interpreter developed at Sable research lab as part of the
McLab project. The mex functionality allows programmers to execute  native code from Matlab. This project is part of a larger project which involves compiling Matlab to CudaC and OpenMP and packaging it as shared library callable from Matlab. The link to the McLab project is :https://github.com/Sable/mclab .
